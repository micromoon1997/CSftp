The directory "papers" contains selected papers by David Poole.

The directory "code" gives code and examples of various
implementations by David Poole. They are all written in Prolog.

The file "poole.bib" gives bibliographic information on these papers,
and serves as an index for the directory. The "file =" field gives
the file name in the directory.

The files are all compressed using "gzip". Our FTP server will
automatically ungzip them for you.
